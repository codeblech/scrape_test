The\nFIA Formula One World Championship\nhas been one of the world's premier forms of\nmotorsport\nsince its\ninaugural running in 1950\nand is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word\nformula\nin the name refers to\nthe set of rules\nall participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as\nGrands Prix\n. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built\ncircuits\nor closed roads.\nA\npoint-system\nis used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships:\none for the drivers\n, and\none for the constructors\n—now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid\nSuper Licence\n, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on\nGrade One tracks\n, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.\nFormula One cars\nare the world's fastest regulated\nroad-course\nracing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic\ndownforce\n, much of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as\nunderbody tunnels\n. The cars depend on electronics,\naerodynamics\n,\nsuspension\n, and\ntyres\n.\nTraction control\n,\nlaunch control\n,\nautomatic shifting\n, and other\nelectronic driving aids\nwere first banned in\n1994\n. They were briefly reintroduced in\n2001\n, and have more recently been banned since\n2004\nand\n2008\n, respectively.\n[\n1\n]\nWith the average annual cost of running a team—designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport—at approximately\n£\n220 million,\n[\n2\n]\nFormula One's financial and political battles are widely reported. The\nFormula One Group\nis owned by\nLiberty Media\n, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm\nCVC Capital Partners\nfor\nUS$\n8 billion.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of Formula One\nFormula One originated from the\nWorld Manufacturers' Championship\n(\n1925\n–\n1930\n) and\nEuropean Drivers' Championship\n(\n1931\n–\n1939\n). The\nformula\nis a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in\n1946\nto officially become effective in\n1947\n. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the\n1946 Turin Grand Prix\n, anticipating the formula's official start.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nBefore\nWorld War II\n, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in\n1950\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe first world championship race, the\n1950 British Grand Prix\n, took place at\nSilverstone Circuit\nin the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950.\n[\n8\n]\nGiuseppe Farina\n, competing for\nAlfa Romeo\n, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate\nJuan Manuel Fangio\n. Fangio won the championship in\n1951\n,\n1954\n,\n1955\n,\n1956\n, and\n1957\n.\n[\n9\n]\nThis set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until\nMichael Schumacher\nwon his sixth championship in 2003.\n[\n9\n]\nJuan Manuel Fangio\n's\n1951\ntitle-winning\nAlfa Romeo 159\nA Constructors' Championship was added in the\n1958 season\n.\nStirling Moss\n, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship.\n[\n10\n]\nBetween 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nFangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered—still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver.\n[\n13\n]\nNational championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in 1983.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nThis era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari,\nMercedes-Benz\nand\nMaserati\n. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's\n158\n, which were\nfront-engined\n, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The\n1952\nand\n1953\nseasons were run to\nFormula Two\nregulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nWhen a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship,\nMercedes-Benz\nintroduced its\nW196\n, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as\ndesmodromic valves\n,\nfuel injection\n, and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the\n1955 Le Mans disaster\n.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\nTechnological developments\n[\nedit\n]\nStirling Moss\n's\nLotus 18\nat the\nNürburgring\nduring\n1961\nThe first major technological development in the sport was\nBugatti\n's introduction of\nmid-engined\ncars.\nJack Brabham\n, the world champion in\n1959\n,\n1960\n, and\n1966\n, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By\n1961\nall teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The\nFerguson P99\n, a\nfour-wheel drive\ndesign, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the\n1961 British Grand Prix\n, the only front-engined car to compete that year.\n[\n20\n]\nDuring\n1962\n,\nLotus\nintroduced a car with an aluminium-sheet\nmonocoque\nchassis instead of the traditional\nspace-frame\ndesign. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars.\nIn\n1968\n,\nsponsorship was introduced to the sport\n.\nTeam Gunston\nbecame the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its\nBrabham\ncars, which\nprivately entered\nin orange, brown and gold colours of\nGunston\ncigarettes in the\n1968 South African Grand Prix\non 1 January 1968.\n[\n21\n]\nFive months later, the first\nworks team\n, Lotus, initially using the\nBritish racing green\n, followed this example when it entered\nits cars\npainted in the red, gold, and white colours of the\nImperial Tobacco\n's Gold Leaf livery at the\n1968 Spanish Grand Prix\n.\nAerodynamic\ndownforce\nslowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of\naerofoils\nduring the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner\nColin Chapman\nwho installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his\nLotus 49\nB at the\n1968 Monaco Grand Prix\n. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced\nground-effect\naerodynamics, previously used on\nJim Hall\n's\nChaparral 2J\nin 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant\nride height\n, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.\n[\n22\n]\nBig business\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning in the 1970s,\nBernie Ecclestone\nrearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nWhen Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the\nFormula One Constructors' Association\n, and in 1978, he became its president.\n[\n25\n]\nPreviously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA.\n[\n24\n]\nHe offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.\n[\n23\n]\nThe formation of the\nFédération Internationale du Sport Automobile\n(FISA) in 1979 set off the\nFISA–FOCA war\n, during which FISA and its president\nJean-Marie Balestre\nargued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations.\n[\n26\n]\nThe Guardian\nsaid that Ecclestone and\nMax Mosley\n\"used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view\". FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races.\n[\n23\n]\nThe result was the 1981\nConcorde Agreement\n, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations.\n[\n27\n]\nAlthough FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.\n[\n28\n]\nFISA imposed a ban on\nground-effect aerodynamics\nduring\n1983\n.\n[\n29\n]\nBut by then,\nturbocharged\nengines, which\nRenault\nhad pioneered in\n1977\n, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were essential to be competitive. By\n1986\n, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated\n[\nwho?\n]\nto be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the\nItalian Grand Prix\n. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost pressure limited to only 4.0 bar.\n[\n30\n]\nThese cars were the most powerful\nopen-wheel\ncircuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in\n1984\n, and\nboost\npressures in\n1988\n, before banning turbocharged engines completely in\n1989\n.\n[\n31\n]\nThe development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of\nactive suspension\n, which first appeared during 1983 on the\nLotus 92\n.\n[\n32\n]\nBy 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by\nAyrton Senna\nin the\nMonaco Grand Prix\nthat year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and\nsemi-automatic gearboxes\nand\ntraction control\nwere a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the\n1994\nseason. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they \"proved difficult to police effectively\".\n[\n33\n]\nThe teams signed a second\nConcorde Agreement\nin 1992 and a third in 1997.\n[\n34\n]\nStefan Johansson\ndriving for\nFerrari\nat the\n1985 European Grand Prix\nOn the track, the\nMcLaren\nand\nWilliams\nteams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was also competitive during the early 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with\nNelson Piquet\n. Powered by\nPorsche\n,\nHonda\n, and\nMercedes-Benz\n, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from\nFord\n, Honda, and\nRenault\nto also win 16 titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The rivalry between racers\nAyrton Senna\nand\nAlain Prost\nbecame F1's central focus during\n1988\nand continued until Prost retired at the end of\n1993\n. Senna\ndied\nat the\n1994 San Marino Grand Prix\nafter crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve\nTamburello\n. The FIA worked to improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which\nRoland Ratzenberger\nalso died in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the\n2014 Japanese Grand Prix\n, where\nJules Bianchi\ncollided with a recovery vehicle after\naquaplaning\noff the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the\n2000 Italian Grand Prix\n,\n[\n35\n]\none at the\n2001 Australian Grand Prix\n[\n35\n]\nand one at the\n2013 Canadian Grand Prix\n.\nSince Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams—most notably the changes introduced for\n1998\n. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller\ncontact patch\nbetween tyre and track. According to the FIA, this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.\n[\n36\n]\nDamon Hill\ndriving for\nWilliams\nat the\n1995 Canadian Grand Prix\nResults were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\nDrivers from\nMcLaren\n,\nWilliams\n,\nRenault\n(formerly\nBenetton\n), and\nFerrari\n, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every\nWorld Championship\nfrom\n1984\nto\n2008\n. The teams won every\nConstructors' Championship\nfrom\n1979\nto\n2008\n, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between\n1989\nand\n1997\n, and winning every race but one (the\n1996 Monaco Grand Prix\n) between\n1988\nand\n1997\n. Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.\nManufacturers' return\n[\nedit\n]\nMichael Schumacher\n(pictured here in\n2001\n) won five consecutive titles with\nFerrari\n.\nMichael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000–2004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999–2004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by\nLewis Hamilton\n), wins in a season (13, since beaten by\nMax Verstappen\n), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021).\n[\n37\n]\nSchumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver\nFernando Alonso\nbecame Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in\n2008\nand followed by\nSebastian Vettel\nin\n2010\n). During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of\nBrawn GP\n.\nDuring this period, FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs.\n[\n38\n]\nTeam orders\n, legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the\n2002 Austrian Grand Prix\n. Other changes included the qualifying format, the point-scoring system, the technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A 'tyre war' between suppliers\nMichelin\nand\nBridgestone\nsaw lap times fall, although, at the\n2005 United States Grand Prix\nat Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season by default. On 20 December 2007 Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.\n[\n39\n]\nDuring 2006, Max Mosley outlined a 'green' future for Formula One, in which efficient use of energy would be an important factor.\n[\n40\n]\nStarting in 2000, with Ford's purchase of\nStewart Grand Prix\nto form the\nJaguar Racing\nteam, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since Alfa Romeo's and Renault's departures in 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams—Renault,\nBMW\n,\nToyota\n, Honda, and Ferrari—dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors' Championship. The exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by Mercedes-Benz. Through the\nGrand Prix Manufacturers Association\n(GPMA), the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.\n[\n41\n]\nManufacturers' decline and return of the privateers\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2008 and 2009,\nHonda\n,\nBMW\n, and\nToyota\nall withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the\neconomic recession\n. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become\nBrawn GP\n, with\nRoss Brawn\nand\nNick Fry\nrunning and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team,\nPeter Sauber\n. The\nLotus F1 Team\n[\n42\n]\nwas another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the\nRenault\nteam by\nGenii Capital\ninvestors. But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a\nRenault\nengine until 2014.\nThe three teams that debuted in 2010 all disappeared within seven years of their debuts.\nMcLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz (McLaren's partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the\nMcLaren Mercedes SLR\nroad car project and tough F1 championships, which included McLaren being found guilty of\nspying on Ferrari\n). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz reentered the sport as a manufacturer after it purchased\nBrawn GP\nand split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.\nDuring the\n2009\nseason, Formula One was gripped by the\nFIA–FOTA dispute\n. FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the next season, including an optional budget cap for the teams;\n[\n43\n]\nteams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings, and an engine not subject to a\nrev limiter\n.\n[\n43\n]\nThe\nFormula One Teams Association\n(FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. But talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the exception of Williams and\nForce India\n,\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\nthat 'they had no choice' but to form a\nbreakaway championship series\n.\n[\n45\n]\nBernie Ecclestone\n, the former Chief executive of the Formula One Group\nOn 24 June, Formula One's governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified,\n[\n46\n]\nand Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October.\n[\n47\n]\nFollowing further disagreements, after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection,\n[\n48\n]\nFOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the 2010 season,\n[\n49\n]\nand an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting.\n[\n50\n]\nOn 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.\n[\n51\n]\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap'. Entrants included a reborn\nTeam Lotus\n—led by a Malaysian consortium including\nTony Fernandes\n, the boss of\nAir Asia\n;\nHispania Racing\n—the first Spanish Formula One team; and\nVirgin Racing\n—\nRichard Branson\n's entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the\nUS F1 Team\n, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams—which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams—ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin, then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, at the end of 2016.\nHybrid era\n[\nedit\n]\nA major rule shakeup in\n2014\nsaw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with\nLewis Hamilton\nwinning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate,\nNico Rosberg\n, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in\n2015\nbefore taking a record 19 wins in\n2016\n, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points. The 2016 season also saw a new team,\nHaas\n, join the grid, while\nMax Verstappen\nbecame the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in\nSpain\n.\n[\n52\n]\nMercedes\nwon eight consecutive constructors' titles and\nLewis Hamilton\nwon six drivers' titles during the beginning of the hybrid era.\nAfter revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced, the\n2017\nand\n2018\nseasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari.\n[\n53\n]\n[\n54\n]\n[\n55\n]\n[\n56\n]\nMercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate in the next two years,\n[\n57\n]\neventually winning seven consecutive Drivers' Championships from 2014 to\n2020\nand eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. During this eight-year period between 2014 and 2021, a Mercedes driver won 111 of the 160 races,\n[\n58\n]\nwith Hamilton winning 81 of these and taking six Drivers' Championships during this period to equal Schumacher's record of seven titles.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nIn\n2021\n, the Honda-powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes, with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times.\nThis era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport. After Honda's return as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 after buying back the\nLotus F1\nteam. In 2018,\nAston Martin\nand\nAlfa Romeo\nbecame Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively. Sauber was rebranded as\nAlfa Romeo Racing\nfor the 2019 season, while\nRacing Point\npart-owner\nLawrence Stroll\nbought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for 2021. In August 2020, all ten F1 teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until 2025, including a $145 million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development.\n[\n62\n]\n[\n63\n]\nThe\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nforced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was pushed back to 2022,\n[\n64\n]\nwith constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced.\n[\n65\n]\nThe start of the\n2020\nseason was delayed by several months,\n[\n66\n]\nand both it and\n2021\nseasons were subject to several postponements, cancellations, and rescheduling of races due to\nshifting restrictions\non international travel. Many races took place\nbehind closed doors\nand with only essential personnel present to maintain\nsocial distancing\n.\n[\n67\n]\nIn 2022, the F1 governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of\nground effects\n, new aerodynamics, larger wheels with low-profile tyres, and redesigned nose and wing regulations.\n[\n68\n]\n[\n69\n]\nRed Bull\nemerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup. The\n2022\nand\n2023\nConstructors' and Drivers' Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen, with multiple races to spare.\n[\n70\n]\n[\n71\n]\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nIn 2023 the FIA opened applications for new teams to enter Formula 1 in the then near future.\n[\n74\n]\nOf the teams that applied, only\nAndretti\nwere approved by the FIA, with them then being rejected by\nFormula One Management\n, though they have launched an appeal.\n[\n75\n]\n[\n76\n]\nIn early 2024, the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations. Having competed for five seasons under the\nAlfa Romeo\nname, Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino\nStake.com\n, resulting in the team's new identity as\nStake F1 Team Kick Sauber\n. Sauber will hold Stake's sponsorship name until the end of 2025, after which it will become the Audi works team for the 2026 season onwards.\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nScuderia AlphaTauri\n, Red Bull's junior team, dropped its name and took on sponsors from Hugo Boss and Cash App, becoming\nVisa\nCash App\nRB, or VCARB for 2024. Also in 2024, Formula One announced partnerships with\nMattel\nto release\nHot Wheels\ndie-cast cars,\n[\n79\n]\nand with\nLego\n, with the first new sets releasing in 2025.\n[\n80\n]\nPreviously, Lego sets based on Formula One cars had been released in 2024.\n[\n81\n]\nThe regulations governing Formula One are set to be revised for the 2026 season, with big changes planned to help encourage closer and more competitive racing.\n[\n82\n]\nChanges include:\nMove to fully sustainable fuels,\nReduction in width and length for closer racing\nnew Front and Rear wing regulations\nElectric Motor\nMGU-K (Motor Generator Unit – Kinetic) power increased from 120 kW to 350 kW\nMore stringent safety requirements\nTighter budget caps\nIn November 2024,\nGeneral Motors\nreached an agreement to enter Formula 1 in 2026 with its\nCadillac\nbrand.\n[\n83\n]\nRacing and strategy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nFormula One racing\n,\nFormula One tyres\n,\nRacing flags\n, and\nFormula One regulations\nA Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice session on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as\nthird drivers\n) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.\n[\n84\n]\n[\n85\n]\nTyre rules\n[\nedit\n]\nThe 2023 Pirelli tyres include (from left to right) the three slick compound tyres: soft (red), medium (yellow), and hard (white) – and the two wet-weather tyre compounds: intermediate (green), and full-wet (blue).\nEach driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend.\n[\n86\n]\nQualifying\n[\nedit\n]\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as\npole position\n. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.\n[\n87\n]\nGrids were generally limited to 26 cars – if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a\npre-qualifying\nsession, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's\nfastest lap\nin that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.\n[\n88\n]\nCurrently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than\n107%\nof the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.\n[\n88\n]\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race.\n[\n89\n]\nAs of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix,\n[\n90\n]\nwhereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards' discretion.\n2021 saw the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix.\n[\n91\n]\nThe system returned for the 2022 season, now titled the 'sprint'.\n[\n92\n]\nFrom 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the 'sprint shootout';\n[\n93\n]\nsuch a system made its debut at the\n2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix\nand is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session required teams to fit new tyres – mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3 – otherwise they cannot participate in the session.\n[\n94\n]\nRace\n[\nedit\n]\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\nJacques Villeneuve\nqualifying at the\n2005 United States Grand Prix\nin his\nSauber C24\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack,\n[\n95\n]\na light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the\n2019\nseason, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.\n[\n96\n]\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it,\nthe red flag is deployed\n; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardized to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989. However, street races like\nMonaco\nhave shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag\n[\n97\n]\ntelling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as \"not classified\" in the results.\nThroughout the race, drivers may make\npit stops\nto change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have\ndifferent colours on their sidewalls\n; this allows spectators to understand the strategies.\nUnder wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use two types of dry tyres.\nRace director\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nRace director § Formula One\nThis role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in\nparc fermé\nbefore a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers. The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations. As of the\n2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix\n, the race director is\nRui Marques\n, with\nHerbie Blash\nas a permanent advisor.\n[\n98\n]\n[\n99\n]\nSafety car\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSafety car § Formula One\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside\nrace marshals\n, race officials may choose to deploy the\nsafety car\n. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with no overtaking permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a\nrolling start\n. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period.\n[\n100\n]\nOn the lap in which the safety car returns to the pit lane, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\nMercedes-Benz\nhas supplied a variety of its\nMercedes-AMG\nmodels to Formula One to use as the safety car since 1996.\n[\n101\n]\nFrom 2021 onwards,\nAston Martin\nhas supplied the\nVantage\nshare duties with Mercedes-AMGs.\n[\n102\n]\nThe\nMercedes-AMG GT R\nsafety car at the\n2019 Hungarian Grand Prix\nAn\nAston Martin Safety Car\nduring the\n2022 Formula One World Championship\nSince 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver\nBernd Mayländer\n.\n[\n103\n]\nHe is usually joined by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race control.\n[\n104\n]\nVirtual Safety Car\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSafety car § Virtual safety car (VSC)\nFollowing an accident at the\n2014 Japanese Grand Prix\n, which saw driver\nJules Bianchi\nsuffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimise the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with\nyellow flags\n. When the virtual safety car is deployed, the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\". All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta.\n[\n105\n]\nThe system was first implemented during the\n2015 Monaco Grand Prix\n, before being upgraded to a full safety car, following a collision between\nMax Verstappen\nand\nRomain Grosjean\n.\n[\n106\n]\nFlags\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nRacing flags\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the\nFIA\n's International Sporting Code.\n[\n107\n]\nFlag\nName\nMeaning\nSC Board\n(Safety Car)\nShown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the\nSafety Car\nis on track. Full course yellow flag applies. Drivers must hold position and slow down.\nVSC Board\n(Virtual Safety Car)\nShown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the\nvirtual safety car\nis in use. During this time, the drivers are given minimum sector times that they must stay above. Full course double yellow flag applies. The car's time relative to this set time is measured at each marshalling post (approximately every 50 m), and the difference is referred to as the car's \"delta\" time. This delta time is reported to the driver, and must remain positive throughout the VSC period else the driver will be penalised.\n[\n108\n]\nYellow\nIndicates a hazard on or near the track (waved yellows indicate a hazard\non the track\n, frozen yellows indicate a hazard\nnear the track\n). Double waved yellows inform drivers that they must slow down as marshals are working on or near to the track and drivers should be prepared to stop.\nGreen\nNormal racing conditions apply. This is usually shown following a yellow flag to indicate that the hazard has been passed. A green flag is shown at all stations for the lap following the end of a full-course yellow (or safety car). A green flag is also shown at the start of a session.\nYellow and red striped\nSlippery track, due to oil, water, or loose debris. Can be seen 'rocked' from side to side (not waved) to indicate a small animal on track.\nBlue\nA blue flag indicates that the driver in front must let faster cars behind them pass because they are being lapped. If the flag is missed 3 times, the driver could be penalised. Accompanied by the driver's number.\nWhite\nIndicates that there is a slow car ahead, either a race car or a course vehicle. Often waved at the end of the pit lane when a car is about to leave the pits.\nBlack and orange circle\nCar is damaged or has a mechanical problem, must return to the pit lane immediately. Will be accompanied by driver's number\nHalf black half white\nWarns a driver for poor sportsmanship or dangerous behaviour. Can be followed by a Black flag upon further infringement. Accompanied by the driver's number.\nBlack\nDriver is disqualified. Will be accompanied by the driver's number. This can be issued after a Half Black Half White flag.\nRed\nA red flag immediately halts a race or session when conditions become too dangerous to continue.\nChequered flag\nEnd of the practice, qualifying, or racing session.\nThe format of the race has changed little through\nFormula One's history\n. The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate's car should theirs develop a problem – in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations.\nSince the 2010 season, refuelling – which was reintroduced in 1994 – has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\nPoints system\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nList of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n5th\n6th\n7th\n8th\n9th\n10th\n25\n18\n15\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n1\nThe Formula One trophy given to the drivers' champion at the end of the year\nVarious systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010,\n[\na\n]\nawards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by them count for the Drivers' Championship.\n[\n109\n]\nA driver must be classified in order to receive points, as of 2022\n[update]\n, a driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.\n[\n110\n]\nFrom some time between the\n1977\nand\n1980 seasons\nto the end of the\n2021 season\nif less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the\n1984\nseason. The last occurrence was at the\n2021 Belgian Grand Prix\nwhen the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car due to torrential rain.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nThe half points rule was replaced by a distance-dependent gradual scale system for\n2022\n.\n[\n113\n]\nConstructors\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of Formula One constructors\n,\nList of Formula One engine constructors\n, and\nList of Formula One World Constructors' Champions\nFerrari\n(pictured with\nCharles Leclerc\n) have competed in every season.\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine.\n[\n114\n]\nIf both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g.,\nFerrari\n). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g.,\nMcLaren\n-\nMercedes\n). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g.,\nWilliams\n-\nFord\n,\nWilliams\n-\nHonda\nin\n1983\n).\n[\n115\n]\nSince\n1981\n,\n[\n116\n]\nFormula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the distinction between the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became less pronounced, though engines may still be produced by a different entity. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the\nIndyCar Series\nwhich allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"\nspec series\n\" such as\nFormula 2\nwhich require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits\nprivateers\n, which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\nThe sport's debut season,\n1950\n, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids. Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\nMcLaren won all but one race in\n1988\nwith engine partner\nHonda\n.\nRenault\n(pictured here with\nNico Hülkenberg\n) has had an active role in Formula One as both constructor and engine supplier since\n1977\n.\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"\nworks team\n\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen).\nCompanies such as\nClimax\n,\nRepco\n,\nCosworth\n,\nHart\n,\nJudd\nand\nSupertec\n, which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier.\n[\n117\n]\nIt is estimated the major teams spend between €100 and €200 million ($125–$225 million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.\n[\n118\n]\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams.\nSuper Aguri\nstarted the season using a modified\nHonda Racing RA106\nchassis (used by Honda the previous year), while\nScuderia Toro Rosso\nused the same chassis used by the parent\nRed Bull Racing\nteam, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis,\n[\n119\n]\n[\n120\n]\nThe regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third-party, an option used by the\nHRT team\nin 2010 and\nHaas\ncurrently.\nAlthough teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated they range from US$66 million to US$400 million each.\n[\n121\n]\nEntering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a $200 million up-front payment to the FIA, which is then shared equally among the existing teams.\n[\n122\n]\nAs a consequence, constructors desiring to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team:\nBAR\n's purchase of\nTyrrell\nand\nMidland\n's purchase of Jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had, such as TV revenue.\nSeven out of the ten teams competing in Formula One are based close to London in an area centred around Oxford. Ferrari have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello, Italy. The\nRB Formula One Team\nis based close to Ferrari in Faenza, whilst Sauber Motorsport is based near Zurich in Switzerland.\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nDrivers\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of Formula One drivers\n,\nList of Formula One World Drivers' Champions\n, and\nList of Formula One driver numbers\n2005 Canadian Grand Prix\n:\nKimi Räikkönen\nleading Michael Schumacher, with\nJarno Trulli\n(\nToyota\n) and\nTakuma Sato\n(\nBAR\n-\nHonda\n) fighting for position\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season.\n[\n85\n]\nA team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions,\n[\n85\n]\nwhich are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car.\n[\n125\n]\n[\n126\n]\nMost drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the possession of a\nFIA Super Licence\nto compete in a Grand Prix,\n[\n127\n]\nwhich is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the\nWorld Motor Sport Council\nif they fail to meet the criteria.\n[\n127\n]\nAlthough most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.\nTeams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team's car; although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers' role mainly takes places on a\nsimulator\n,\n[\n128\n]\nsuch as\nrFactor Pro\n,\n[\n129\n]\n[\n130\n]\nwhich is used by most of the F1 teams.\n[\n131\n]\n[\n132\n]\nEach driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99 (excluding 17 which was retired following the death of\nJules Bianchi\n)\n[\n133\n]\nupon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one.\n[\n134\n]\nAt the onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race.\n[\n135\n]\nPermanent numbers were introduced in\n1973\nto take effect in\n1974\n, when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors' Championship standings at the end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers' Champion, which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion's team. New entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception of the number 13 which had been unused since\n1976\n.\n[\n136\n]\nAs teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car numbers became associated with a team, such as\nFerrari's\n27 and 28.\n[\n135\n]\nA different system was used from\n1996\nto\n2013\n: at the start of each season, the current Drivers' Champion was designated number one, their teammate number two, and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous season's Constructors' Championship order.\n[\n137\n]\nAs of 2024\n[update]\n, a total of 34 separate drivers have won the World Drivers' Championship, with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven. Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins, too, in 2020.\nJochen Rindt\nis the only posthumous World Champion, after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the\n1970 Italian Grand Prix\n, with 4 races still remaining in the season.\nDrivers from the United Kingdom\nhave been the most successful in the sport, with 20 championships among 10 drivers, and 316 wins.\n[\n138\n]\nPhysical demands\n[\nedit\n]\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2–4 kg (4–9 lb) of weight per race.\n[\n139\n]\n[\n140\n]\nA key reason for the physical demands is the extreme\ng-forces\ngenerated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5\ng\ns when cornering, 6\ng\ns when braking and 2\ng\ns when accelerating.\n[\n141\n]\n[\n142\n]\n[\n143\n]\nWhen a driver experiences 6\ng\n, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb), this would be 480 kg (1,058 lb).\n[\n144\n]\nAnother factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver. The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as 60 °C (140 °F) and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof\nracing clothing\n.\n[\n145\n]\n[\n146\n]\nThe steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of\npower steering\nin the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40–50 newton-metres (30–37 lb⋅ft),\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nwhile achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal.\n[\n149\n]\nDrivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance.\n[\n139\n]\nDrivers also need to train on cardiovascular fitness since heart rates can average more than 170 bpm during a race, this is more than a healthy adult would typically experience while running.\n[\n150\n]\nFeeder series\n[\nedit\n]\nFIA Formula 2 Championship\n, the main F1 feeder series since\n2017\nFIA Formula 3 Championship\n, the main F1 and F2 feeder series since\n2019\nMost F1 drivers start in\nkart racing\ncompetitions and then come up through traditional European single-seater series like\nFormula Ford\nand\nFormula Renault\nto\nFormula 3\n, and finally the\nGP2 Series\n. GP2 started in 2005, replacing\nFormula 3000\n, which itself had replaced\nFormula Two\nas the last major stepping-stone into F1. GP2 was rebranded as the\nFIA Formula 2 Championship\nin 2017. Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion Lewis Hamilton became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One drivers' title in 2008.\n[\n151\n]\nDrivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One.\nBritish F3\nhas supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including\nNigel Mansell\n,\nAyrton Senna\nand\nMika Häkkinen\nhaving moved straight from that series to Formula One, and\nMax Verstappen\nmade his F1 debut following a single season in\nEuropean F3\n. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with\n2007\nWorld Champion\nKimi Räikkönen\n, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1.\n[\n152\n]\nAmerican open-wheel car racing\nhas also contributed to the Formula One grid.\nCART\nchampions\nMario Andretti\nand\nJacques Villeneuve\nbecame F1 World Champions, while\nJuan Pablo Montoya\nwon seven races in F1.

Other drivers have taken different paths to F1; Damon Hill raced motorbikes, and Michael Schumacher raced in\nsports cars\n, albeit after climbing through the junior single-seater ranks. Former F1 driver\nPaul di Resta\nraced in\nDTM\nuntil he was signed with\nForce India\nin 2011.\nGrands Prix\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of Formula One Grands Prix\nWorld map showing the location of Formula 1 Grands Prix: countries marked in green are on the current race schedule, those in dark grey have hosted a Formula One race in the past. (\nDe facto\nstatus of the territories is shown.)\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural\n1950\nWorld Championship season comprised only seven races, while the\n2024\nseason contained 24 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season.\n[\n153\n]\nThere were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races.\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the\nIndianapolis 500\n, which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the\nUnited States Grand Prix\n. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in\n1953\n, and\nMorocco\nhosted the first African World Championship race in\n1958\n. Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in\n1976\nand Australia in\n1985\n), and the first race in the Middle East was held in\n2004\n. The 19 races of the\n2014\nseason were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands Prix held outside Europe.\nSome of the Grands Prix pre-date the formation of the World Championship, such as the\nFrench Grand Prix\nand were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The\nBritish\nand\nItalian\nGrands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German, and French Grands Prix. The\nMonaco Grand Prix\nwas first held in 1929 and has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020) and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.\n[\n154\n]\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural\nSingapore Grand Prix\nhosted the first Formula One night race in 2008,\n[\n155\n]\nwhich was followed by the day–night\nAbu Dhabi Grand Prix\nin 2009 and the\nBahrain Grand Prix\nwhich converted to a night race in 2014.

In most cases, the tracks run in a\nclockwise\ndirection, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\nA typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with the\npit lane\nnormally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team's garage, where cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a\npit stop\n, drivers enter the pit lane to change their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their\npit crew\n, or\nretire\nfrom the race (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the\n2010\nseason, pit stops also facilitated mid-race refueling of the cars.\n[\n185\n]\nSpecial pit roads and track markings help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks include\nMonaco\n,\nMelbourne\n,\nSingapore\n,\nBaku\n,\nMiami\n,\nJeddah\n, and\nLas Vegas\n. Three-time World champion\nNelson Piquet\nfamously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".\n[\n186\n]\nThe Monaco Grand Prix holds a unique exception to the FIA's minimum race distance requirement—the Grand Prix only needs to last enough laps to cover a distance of 260 km, versus the standard 305 km.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the\nBahrain International Circuit\n, added in\n2004\nand designed – like most of F1's new circuits – by\nHermann Tilke\n. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as\nSpa-Francorchamps\nand Imola.\n[\n189\n]\nHis redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\n[\n190\n]\nThe\nCircuit of the Americas\nin\nAustin\n, the\nSochi Autodrom\nin\nSochi\nand the\nBaku City Circuit\nin\nAzerbaijan\nhave all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020,\nAlgarve International Circuit\ndebuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the\nPortuguese Grand Prix\n, with the country having last hosted a race in 1996.\n[\nb\n]\nIn 2021,\nCircuit Zandvoort\nreturned to the F1 calendar as the\nDutch Grand Prix\n, having last hosted a race in 1985.\n[\n191\n]\nThe\nLas Vegas Grand Prix\nentered the sport in 2023.\n[\n192\n]\nCars and technology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nFormula One car\n,\nFormula One engines\n, and\nFormula One tyres\nJenson Button\nin the\nBrawn BGP 001\nModern Formula One cars are\nmid-engined\n, hybrid, semi-open cockpit,\nopen-wheel\nsingle-seaters. The\nchassis\nis made largely of\ncarbon-fibre composites\n, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 795 kg (1,753 lb) – the minimum weight set by the regulations.\n[\n193\n]\nIf the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be\nballasted\nup to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the\ncentre of gravity\nas low as possible in order to improve handling and\nweight transfer\n.\n[\n194\n]\nThe cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic\ndownforce\nthat they generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by\nground effect\ncreated by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the\ntyres\n. From\n1998\nto\n2008\n, the tyres in Formula One were not \"\nslicks\n\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars.\n[\n195\n]\nSlick tyres returned to Formula One in the\n2009\nseason. Suspension is\ndouble wishbone\nor\nmultilink\nfront and rear, with pushrod operated springs and\ndampers\non the\nchassis\n– one exception being that of the 2009 specification\nRed Bull Racing\ncar (\nRB5\n) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the\nMinardi\nPS01 in 2001.\nFerrari\nused a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their\n2012\ncar.\n[\n196\n]\nBoth Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear. In\n2022\n,\nMcLaren\n(\nMCL36\n) and\nRed Bull Racing\n(\nRB18\n) switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension.\n[\n197\n]\n[\n198\n]\nCarbon-carbon\ndisc brakes\nare used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula. The carbon\n[\n199\n]\nmaterial enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance\n[\n200\n]\nunder extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring for maximum performance and cooling.\nIn\n2022\n, the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the\nturbulence\n(commonly referred to as \"dirty air\") produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of\nGround effect\ndownforce production. These have been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car. It allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to the turbulent air.\n[\n201\n]\n(See\n2022 Formula One World Championship Technical regulations\n)\nFormula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two\nmagnesium alloys\nspecified by the FIA.\n[\n202\n]\nMagnesium alloy wheels\nmade by\nforging\nare used to achieve maximum\nunsprung rotating weight\nreduction.\n[\n203\n]\nAs of 2022, the wheels are covered with \"spec\" (Standardised) Wheel Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches (reducing the \"tyre profile\"), and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.\n[\n204\n]\nA\nBMW Sauber\nP86 V8 engine, which powered their\n2006\nF1.06\nStarting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units.\n[\n205\n]\nThese get a significant amount of their power from electric motors. In addition, they include a lot of energy recovery technology. Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol.\n[\n206\n]\nThe oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000\nrpm\nand produced over 580 kW (780 bhp).\n[\n207\n]\nFor\n2007\n, engines were restricted to 19,000 rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze since the end of\n2006\n.\n[\n208\n]\nFor the 2009 Formula One season the engines were further restricted to 18,000 rpm.\n[\n209\n]\nA wide variety of technologies – including active suspension\n[\n210\n]\nare banned under the current regulations. Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h (220 mph) at some circuits.\n[\n211\n]\nThe highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph), set by\nJuan Pablo Montoya\nduring the\n2005 Italian Grand Prix\n.\n[\n212\n]\nDuring qualifying for the\n2016 European Grand Prix\n,\nValtteri Bottas\nset a record top speed of 378 km/h (234.9 mph).\n[\n213\n]\nA\nBAR-Honda Formula One car\n, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the\nMojave Desert\nachieved a top speed of 415 km/h (258 mph) in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations.\n[\n214\n]\nEven with the limitations on aerodynamics, at 160 km/h (99 mph) aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to \"drive on the ceiling\", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering.\n[\n215\n]\nConsequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance road car like the\nEnzo Ferrari\nonly achieves around 1g.\n[\n216\n]\nAs of 2019\n[update]\n, each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time.\n[\n217\n]\nEach driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team. If more engines are used, they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used. The only exception is where the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season, in which case up to five may be used by a driver.\n[\n218\n]\nEach driver may use no more than one gearbox for six consecutive events; every unscheduled gearbox change requires the driver to drop five places on the grid unless they failed to finish the previous race due to reasons beyond the team's control.\n[\n219\n]\nAs of 2019\n[update]\n, each driver is limited to three power units per season, before incurring grid penalties.\nRevenue and profits\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section needs to be\nupdated\n. The reason given is: Needs update to account for the ban in private testing..\nPlease help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\n(\nOctober 2024\n)\nEstimated budget split of a Formula One team based on the\n2006\nseason\nIn March 2007,\nF1 Racing\npublished its annual estimates of spending by Formula One teams.\n[\n220\n]\nThe total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US. This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m,\nMidland F1/Spyker-MF1\n$120 m,\nToro Rosso\n$75 m, and\nSuper Aguri\n$57 million.\nCosts vary greatly from team to team. Honda, Toyota, McLaren-Mercedes, and Ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately $200 million on engines in 2006, Renault spent approximately $125 million and Cosworth's 2006 V8 was developed for $15 million.\n[\n221\n]\nIn contrast to the 2006 season on which these figures are based, the 2007 sporting regulations banned all performance-related engine development.\n[\n222\n]\nFormula One teams pay entry fees of $500,000, plus $5,000 per point scored the previous year or $6,000 per point for the winner of the Constructors' Championship. Formula One drivers pay a\nFIA Super Licence\nfee, which in 2013 was €10,000 plus €1,000 per point.\n[\n223\n]\nThere have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams. The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared, favouring established top teams. In September 2015,\nForce India\nand\nSauber\nofficially lodged a complaint with the\nEuropean Union\nagainst Formula One questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful.\n[\n224\n]\nThe cost of building a brand-new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars, while the cost of converting a public road, such as\nAlbert Park\n, into a temporary circuit is much less. Permanent circuits, however, can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races, such as\nMotoGP\n. The\nShanghai International Circuit\ncost over $300 million\n[\n225\n]\nand the\nIstanbul Park\ncircuit cost $150 million to build.\n[\n226\n]\nA number of Formula One drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing. The highest-paid driver in 2021 is Lewis Hamilton, who received $55 million in salary from Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 – a record for any driver.\n[\n227\n]\nThe very top Formula One drivers get paid more than\nIndyCar\nor\nNASCAR\ndrivers; however, the earnings immediately fall off after the top three F1 drivers, and the majority of\nNASCAR\nracers will make more money than their F1 counterparts.\n[\n228\n]\nMost top IndyCar drivers are paid around a tenth of their Formula One counterparts.\n[\n227\n]\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Formula One reported a loss revenue of $122 million and an income of $24 million. This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n. The company grossed revenues of $620 million for the same quarter the previous year.\n[\n229\n]\nCost cap\n[\nedit\n]\nSince the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport's governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team. This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase.\n[\n230\n]\nFor instance, in 2019, the richest teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari spent $420 million and $435 million respectively,\n[\n231\n]\nwhereas teams such as Williams or Haas, only spent $125 million and $150 million respectively.\n[\n232\n]\nThis gap was widening by the season and disparities like this prompted the FIA to introduce a cost cap in February 2021.\nThe FIA proposed the cost cap as a measure to reward engineering prowess over sheer expenditure. They did this in an effort to bridge the gap between the midfield teams and the teams challenging for the driver's and constructors' titles.\nThe cap was $175 million in 2021, although was reduced further to $145 million in response to economic turmoil due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n. For 2022, the cost cap was further reduced to $140 million and in 2023 it fell to $135 million where it will remain for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.\n[\n233\n]\n[\n234\n]\nThe 2022 season served as a critical test for the effectiveness of the cost cap as it was the year the new regulations were introduced, allowing all teams to start from scratch and build a car that was independent of the previous years. Critics have argued that the cap might not be sufficient enough to close the gap in competition because it excluded certain expenses like driver salaries, compensation for the three highest paid-staff members, and marketing costs along with loopholes that allowed the likes of Adrian Newey's salary of Red Bull to be excluded from the cost cap.\n[\n235\n]\nThey also contended that established teams could exploit existing infrastructures and resources accumulated over years, thus maintaining their competitive edge despite the spending limits.\nHowever, an alternative perspective highlights that the cost cap encourages teams to maximise efficiency and foster innovation within their financial means. McLaren started the\n2023 season\nas the slowest car on the track, with their drivers finishing outside the points with\nLando Norris\nat P17 and\nOscar Piastri\nat P20. Seven months later, with the right upgrades, they managed to be the fastest car on the grid throughout qualifying and race pace. Facing budgetary constraints similar to their competitors, McLaren focused on strategic engineering upgrades and talent development. Their significant mid-season improvements led to notable on-track success, demonstrating that with clever resource management and engineering talent, teams can challenge the dominance of traditionally wealthier competitors.\nMcLaren CEO\nZak Brown\nsaid that \"the cap has been outstanding for the sport.\" He also went on to say that there is a feeling that at any point in the season, any team can challenge for a place it wasn't equipped to do so at the start of the season.\n[\n236\n]\nThe critics have expressed that the impact of the cost cap suggests that engineering excellence and strategic ingenuity can indeed offset the advantages of larger budgets. By promoting a more balanced competitive environment, the cost cap has made Formula 1 more exciting for fans and more viable for teams.\nFuture\n[\nedit\n]\nA sign announcing that the\nsafety car\n(SC) is deployed\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport.\n[\n237\n]\n[\n238\n]\nFollowing their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in 2017,\nLiberty Media\nannounced their vision for the future of Formula One at the\n2018 Bahrain Grand Prix\n. The proposal identified five key areas, including streamlining the governance of the sport, emphasising cost-effectiveness, maintaining the sport's relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive.\n[\n239\n]\nOn 19 August 2020, it was announced that all 10 teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement.\n[\n240\n]\nThis came into effect at the start of the 2021 season and changed how prize money and TV revenue is distributed.\n[\n241\n]\nEnvironmental impact\n[\nedit\n]\nFormula One has initiated a plan to become\ncarbon neutral\nby 2030. By 2025, all events should become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.\n[\n242\n]\nA report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for 256,000 tonnes of\ncarbon dioxide\nemissions in the\n2019 season\n, finding that 45% of emissions were from logistics and only 0.7% were from emissions from the cars themselves.\n[\n243\n]\n[\n244\n]\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations \"Sports for Climate Action\" framework. After the signing was announced, FIA President Jean Todt said: \"As an international Federation comprising 244 members in 140 countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development, we are fully committed to global environmental protection. The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years. Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F1 to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission, the entire FIA community has been investing time, energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations. We aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards.\"\n[\n245\n]\nFrom the 2021–22 season, all cars will increase the bio-component of their fuel, using\nE10 fuel\n, rather than the 5.75% of\nethanol\ncurrently used. This percentage is expected to grow again in the future.\n[\n246\n]\nIn December 2020, the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with 100% sustainability, to be used in Formula One from either 2025 or 2026, when new engine regulations come into force.\n[\n247\n]\nSocial inequities\n[\nedit\n]\nPrior to the beginning of the\n2020 Formula One World Championship\n, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative.\n[\n248\n]\nThe initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\".\n[\n248\n]\nThe move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport. The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver,\nLewis Hamilton\n, participating in the world championship since 2007.\n[\n249\n]\nIn addition to organization-wide measures, individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport's cultural and political activism. During the 2020 season, the\nMercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team\nconducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately 95% of its workforce was white.\n[\n250\n]\nDue to the results of the study, the team changed the car's livery to promote anti-racism messages and also launched the Accelerate 25 programme. The program vows that approximately 25% of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until 2025.\n[\n251\n]\nThe 20 drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track. Following the\nmurder of George Floyd\nin the summer of 2020, all twenty drivers wore \"End Racism\" shirts and took part in an organised anti-racism protest during the pre-race formalities.\n[\n252\n]\nIn the year since,\nLewis Hamilton\nhas remained vocal in his pre-race attire, with other drivers occasionally wearing change-demanding clothing.\n[\n253\n]\nWomen in Formula One\n[\nedit\n]\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score. The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show,\nDrive to Survive\n, the female viewership of the sport has risen. In 2019 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40%.\n[\n254\n]\nF1 Academy\n[\nedit\n]\nF1 Academy\n, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship. Its inaugural championship was won by\nMarta García\nof\nPrema Racing\n. The establishment of F1 Academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport;\nNetflix\nhas announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this companies such as\nTommy Hilfiger\n,\nCharlotte Tilbury\n,\n[\n255\n]\nPuma\n, and\nRed Bull\nhave become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity.\n[\n256\n]\nFemale Formula One drivers\n[\nedit\n]\nMaria Teresa de Filippis\nwas the first female to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.\n[\n257\n]\nLella Lombardi\nis the only female to place within the points at a Formula One Grand Prix. She competed in three seasons, entering seventeen races, and starting twelve. After finishing sixth in the\n1975 Spanish Grand Prix\n, Lombardi became the first and only female to score points during an official Formula Grand Prix. Due to the race not reaching full completion half points were awarded and Lombardi only gained .5 points.\n[\n258\n]\nDesiré Wilson\nthe only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind, winning the second round of the\n1980 Aurora AFX F1 Championship\n.\nRace engineers\n[\nedit\n]\nHannah Schmitz\ncurrently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at\nRed Bull Racing\n. She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within\nRed Bull Racing\n.\n[\n259\n]\nTeam principals\n[\nedit\n]\nSusie Wolff\nis the current managing director of\nF1 Academy\n, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades. In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing.\n[\n260\n]\nIn 2012 Wolff was a\nWilliams Grand Prix Engineering\ndevelopment driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team. After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team\nVenturi Racing\n, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\nAustrian\nMonisha Kaltenborn\nbecame the sport's first ever female Team principal when she took over the role at\nSauber Formula 1 Team\nin 2010.\n[\n261\n]\nMedia and presenters\n[\nedit\n]\nNatalie Pinkham\nis a British television presenter and pit lane reporter for\nSky Sports F1\n. She joined the television channel in 2012, and became the first woman commentator on British TV.\n[\n262\n]\nNaomi Schiff\nis a retired racing driver who is currently working as a television presenter for\nSky Sports F1\n. After her retirement in 2020 she worked as the diversity and inclusion ambassador for the\nW Series\n, before joining the UK based television channel in 2022.\n[\n263\n]\nMedia coverage\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of Formula One broadcasters\nFormula One is broadcast live, or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences. The\n2008 season\nattracted a global audience of 600 million people per race.\n[\n264\n]\nThe cumulative television audience was calculated to be 54 billion for the 2001 season, broadcast to 200 territories.\n[\n265\n]\nDuring the early 1990s, Formula One Group created a number of trademarks, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website for the sport in an attempt to give it a corporate identity.\nTV stations all take what is known as the \"World Feed\", either produced historically by the \"host broadcaster\" or by\nFormula One Management\n(FOM). The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds – a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\nThe only station that differed from this set up was \"DF1\" (re-branded to \"Premiere\" then to \"Sky Deutschland\") – a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard and pit-lane channels. This service was purchased by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of 1996 and became F1 Digital Plus, which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of 2002, when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much.\nOn 12 January 2011, F1 announced that it would adopt the\nHD\nformat for the 2011 season.\n[\n266\n]\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that\nSky Sports\nand the\nBBC\nwould team up to show the races in F1 from 2012 to 2018.\nSky\nlaunched a dedicated channel,\nSky Sports F1\nwhich covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1 programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows.\n[\n267\n]\nIn 2012 the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season.\n[\n268\n]\nThe BBC ended its television contract after the 2015 season, three years earlier than planned.\n[\n269\n]\nThe free-to-air TV rights were picked up by\nChannel 4\nuntil the end of the 2018 season.\n[\n270\n]\nSky Sports F1 coverage remained unaffected and\nBBC Radio 5 Live\nand\n5 Sports Extra\ncoverage was extended until 2021.\n[\n271\n]\nAs of 2022, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra has rights to such coverage until 2024.\n[\n272\n]\nWhile Sky Sports and Channel 4 are the two major broadcasters of Formula 1, other countries show Formula One races. Many use commentary from either Sky Sports or Channel 4. In most of Asia (excluding China), the two main broadcasters of Formula One includes the Fox network and Star Sports (in India). In the United States,\nESPN\nholds the official rights to broadcast the sport while\nABC\nalso holds free-to-air rights for some races under the\nESPN on ABC\nbanner. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the two main broadcasters are RTL Germany and n-TV. In China, there are multiple channels that broadcast Formula One which include CCTV, Tencent, Guangdong TV and Shanghai TV.\n[\n273\n]\nCurrently in France, the only channel that broadcasts Formula One is the pay TV channel\nCanal+\n, having renewed its broadcasting rights until 2024.\n[\n274\n]\nThe official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the\nApple App Store\nsince 2009,\n[\n275\n]\nand on\nGoogle Play\nsince 2011,\n[\n276\n]\nthat shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing and commentary.\n[\n277\n]\nOn 26 November 2017 Formula One unveiled a new logo, which replaced the previous \"flying one\" in use since 1993.\n[\n278\n]\nIn March 2018, FOM announced the launch of F1 TV, an\nover-the-top streaming platform\nthat lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary.\n[\n279\n]\nIn April 2024, FOM launched a\nfree ad-supported streaming television\nchannel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the\nUnited States\n, which shows classic Grands Prix, documentaries and analysis from past races.\n[\n280\n]\nDistinction between Formula One and World Championship races\n[\nedit\n]\nCurrently, the terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" are effectively synonymous. Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations. However, the two terms are not interchangeable.\nThe first Formula One race was held in 1946,\n[\n281\n]\nwhereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.\n[\n281\n]\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship;\n[\n282\n]\nin 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship.\n[\n281\n]\nThe number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the\n1983 Race of Champions\n.\n[\n282\n]\nThe World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\nThe World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e. without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the\nIndianapolis 500\nrace counted towards the World Championship.\n[\n282\n]\nThis race was run to\nAmerican Automobile Association\n, and later\nUnited States Automobile Club\n,\nChampionship Car\nregulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars,\nAlberto Ascari\nin\n1952\n, started at Indianapolis during this period.\n[\n283\n]\nFrom 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations.\n[\n282\n]\nFormula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.\n[\n284\n]\n[\n285\n]\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the\nList of Formula One drivers\n,\nClemente Biondetti\nis shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950,\n[\n286\n]\nbut only one of these counted for the World Championship.\nIn the earlier history of Formula One, many races took place outside the World Championship, and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred. These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.\n[\n14\n]\nEuropean non-championship racing\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly\nAlfa Romeo\n. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in\n1950\na total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship.\n[\n281\n]\nIn 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the\nRace of Champions\n,\nOulton Park International Gold Cup\nand the\nInternational Trophy\n, were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the\nSyracuse\nand\nDanish\nGrands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid.\n[\n14\n]\nThese became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the\n1983 Race of Champions\nat Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion\nKeke Rosberg\nin a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American\nDanny Sullivan\n.\n[\n14\n]\nSouth African Formula One championship\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSouth African Formula One Championship\nSouth Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there was also a healthy selection of locally built or modified machines.\nBritish Formula One Championship\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nBritish Formula One Championship\nThe\nDFV\nhelped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a decade before, second-hand cars from manufacturers like\nLotus\nand\nFittipaldi Automotive\nwere the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series. In 1980, the series saw\nSouth African\nDesiré Wilson\nbecome the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a\nWolf WR3\n.\n[\n287\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nFormula One portal\nFormula One video games\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nFrom 2019 to 2024, an additional point was awarded to the car which set the fastest lap, if that car finished inside the top 10.\n^\na\nb\nThe Portuguese Grand Prix featured on the\n2020\ncalendar following the cancellation of events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
